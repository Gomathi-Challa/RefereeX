Clustering is defined as an unsupervised learning where the objects are grouped on the basis of some \nsimilarity inherent among them. There are different methods for clustering the objects such as hierarchical, \npartitional, grid, density based and model based. The approaches used in these methods are discussed with their \nrespective states of art and applicability. The measures of similarity as well as the evaluation criteria, which are \nthe central components of clustering are also presented in the paper. The applications of clustering in some \nfields like image segmentation, object and character recognition and data mining are highlighted.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy of Withania somnifera (Ws) to limit myocardial injury after ischemia and reperfusion was explored and compared\nto that of Vit E, a reference standard known to reduce mortality and infarct size due to myocardial infarction. Wistar rats (150\u2013\n200 g) were divided into six groups and received orally saline (sham, control group), Ws-50/kg (Ws control and treated group)\nand Vit E-100 mg/kg (Vit E control and treated group) respectively for 1 month. On the 31st day, rats of the control, Vit E and\nWs treated groups were anesthetized and subjected to 45 min occlusion of the LAD coronary artery followed by 60 min\nreperfusion. Hemodynamic parameters: systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP, MAP), heart rate (HR), left\nventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular peak (+)LVdP/dt and (\u2013)LVdP/dt were monitored. Hearts were\nremoved and processed for histopathological and biochemical studies: Myocardial enzyme viz, creatin phosphokinase (CPK),\nand antioxidant parameters: malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glu-\ntathione peroxidase (GSHPx) were estimated. Postischemic reperfusion produced significant cardiac necrosis, depression of\nleft ventricular functions (MAP, LVEDP, (+) and (\u2013)LVdP/dt) and a significant fall in GSH (p < 0.01), SOD, CAT (p < 0.05),\nLDH and CPK (p < 0.01) as well as an increase in MDA level (p < 0.05) in the control group rats as compared to sham group.\nThe changes in levels of protein and GPx was however, not significant. Ws and Vit E favorably modulated most of the hemo-\ndynamic, biochemical and histopathological parameters though no significant restoration in GSH, MAP (with Vit E) were ob-\nserved. Ws on chronic administration markedly augmented antioxidants (GSH, GSHPx, SOD, CAT) while Vit E did not stimulate\nthe synthesis of endogenous antioxidants compared to sham. Results indicate that Ws significantly reduced myocardial injury\nand emphasize the beneficial action of Ws as a cardioprotective agent.

            "Background \u2014A recent case-control study suggested a benefit of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in lowering the risk of cardiac manifestations of neonatal lupus (cardiac-NL) in pregnancies of anti-SSA/Ro\u2013positive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. A historical cohort assembled from 3 international databases was used to evaluate whether HCQ reduces the nearly 10-fold increase in risk of recurrence of cardiac-NL independently of maternal health status. Methods and Results \u2014Two hundred fifty-seven pregnancies of anti-SSA/Ro-positive mothers (40 exposed and 217 unexposed to HCQ) subsequent to the birth of a child with cardiac-NL were identified from 3 databases (United States, England, and France). Exposure was defined as the sustained use of HCQ throughout pregnancy with initiation before 10 weeks of gestation. The recurrence rate of cardiac-NL in fetuses exposed to HCQ was 7.5% (3 of 40) compared with 21.2% (46 of 217) in the unexposed group ( P \u0001 0.050). Although there were no deaths in the exposed group, the overall case fatality rate of the cardiac-NL fetuses in the unexposed group was 21.7%. In a multivariable analysis that adjusted for database source, maternal race/ethnicity, and anti-SSB/La status, HCQ use remained significantly associated with a decreased risk of cardiac-NL (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.06\u20130.92;  P \u0001 0.037). Similar results were obtained with propensity score analysis, an alternative approach to adjust for possible confounding by indication. Conclusion \u2014Aggregate data from a multinational effort show that in mothers at high risk of having a child with cardiac-NL, the use of HCQ may protect against recurrence of disease in a subsequent pregnancy.

Measurements of water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) were performed by a modi\ufb01cation of the wet cup method described by ASTM E 96-95, indicating that membranes with 10% nanocrystalline cellulose, prepared using a sulfuric acid, exhibited the lowest permeability value of 174 g mil/h m 2   among the com- posite \ufb01lms studied. Both the acacia and the softwood kraft pulp \ufb01bers when used for xylan \ufb01lm formation exhibited higher water vapor transmission rates at addition levels of 50% and no improvement at lower levels of 5% and 10%, in comparison to control xylan \ufb01lms. Reinforcement of xylan with hydrochloric acid made nanocrystalline cellulose yielded \ufb01lms that showed a reduction in water transmission but the reduction was not as signi\ufb01cant as with the reinforcement of xylan with sulfuric nanocrystalline cellu- lose. The results showed that xylan \ufb01lms reinforced with 10% sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose exhibited reductions in water transmission rates of 362%, 62% and 61% over \ufb01lms prepared with 10% softwood kraft \ufb01bers, 10% acacia \ufb01ber and 10% hydrochloric acid prepared nanocrystalline cellulose, respectively. The morphology of the resulting nanocomposite \ufb01lms was examined by SEM and AFM which showed that control \ufb01lms containing xylan and sorbitol had a more open structure as compared to xylan\u2013sorbitol \ufb01lms containing sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose. The results from FT-IR suggested strong interactions occurred between the nanocrystalline cellulose and the matrix. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

            "Petrochemically based polymers, such as polyole\ufb01ns and polyesters, have been increasingly used as packaging materi- als due, in part, to their availability, low cost and favorable mechanical properties, but their non-biodegradability has gen- erated environmental concerns ( Tharanathan & Saroja, 2001 ). The advantages of using biopolymers to produce such packaging \ufb01lms include their renewability, availability, limited environmen- tal impact and simpli\ufb01ed end-of-life disposal issues ( Petersson & Oksman, 2006; Ragauskas et al., 2006; Samir, Alloin, & Dufresne, 2005 ). Early studies examined the application of chitosan, starch and cellulose derivatives for their \ufb01lm forming properties ( Krochta et al., 1994 ). Xylan is one of the most common hemicelluloses and is the most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellu- lose ( Coughlan & Hazlewood, 1993; Ebringerov\u00e1 & Heinze, 2000; Gabrielli & Gatenholm, 1998 ).

            "Objective.  Enrollment of patients of Black African ancestry with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in phase II and phase III of the belimumab trials was not re \ufb02 ective of the racial distribution observed in the lupus population. This study was undertaken to assess the ef \ufb01 cacy and safety of intravenous (IV) belimumab plus standard therapy in patients of self-identi \ufb01 ed Black race. Methods.  EMBRACE (GSK Study BEL115471; ClinicalTrials.gov identi \ufb01 er: NCT01632241) was a 52-week multi- center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults of self-identi \ufb01 ed Black race with active SLE who received monthly belimumab 10 mg/kg IV, or placebo, plus standard therapy. The optional 26-week open-label extension phase included patients who completed the double-blind phase. The primary end point of the study was SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rate at week 52 with modi \ufb01 ed proteinuria scoring adapted from the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) (SRI \u2013 SLEDAI-2K). Key secondary end points included SRI response rate at week 52, time to  \ufb01 rst severe SLE  \ufb02 are, and reductions in prednisone dose. Results.  The modi \ufb01 ed intent-to-treat population comprised 448 patients, of whom 96.9% were women and the mean  \u0001  SD age was 38.8  \u0001  11.42 years. The primary end point (improvement in the SRI \u2013 SLEDAI-2K response rate at week 52) was not achieved (belimumab 48.7%, placebo 41.6%; odds ratio 1.40 [95% con \ufb01 dence interval 0.93, 2.11],  P  =  0.1068); however, numerical improvements favoring belimumab were observed, in which the SRI \u2013 SLEDAI- 2K response rates were higher in those who received belimumab compared with those who received placebo, espe- cially in patients with SLE who had high disease activity or renal manifestations at baseline. The safety pro \ufb01 le of belimu- mab was generally consistent with that observed in previous SLE trials. Adverse events were the primary reasons for double-blind phase withdrawals (belimumab 5.4%, placebo 6.7%). Conclusion.  The primary end point of this study was not achieved, but improvement with belimumab versus pla- cebo was observed, suggesting that belimumab remains a suitable treatment option for SLE management in patients of Black African ancestry.",

            "Rationale:  Diabetes mellitus is associated with cardiac fibrosis. Matricellular proteins are induced in fibrotic  conditions and modulate fibrogenic and angiogenic responses by regulating growth factor signaling. Objective:  Our aim was to test the hypothesis that the prototypical matricellular protein thrombospondin (TSP)- 1, a potent angiostatic molecule and crucial activator of transforming growth factor- \u03b2 , may play a key role in  remodeling of the diabetic heart. Methods and Results:  Obese diabetic db/db mice exhibited marked myocardial TSP-1 upregulation in the  interstitial and perivascular space. To study the role of TSP-1 in remodeling of the diabetic heart, we generated  and characterized db/db TSP-1 \u2013/\u2013  (dbTSP) mice. TSP-1 disruption did not significantly affect weight gain and  metabolic function in db/db animals. When compared with db/db animals, dbTSP mice had increased left  ventricular dilation associated with mild nonprogressive systolic dysfunction. Chamber dilation in dbTSP mice  was associated with decreased myocardial collagen content and accentuated matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9  activity. TSP-1 disruption did not affect inflammatory gene expression and activation of transforming growth  factor- \u03b2 /small mothers against decapendaplegic signaling in the db/db myocardium. In cardiac fibroblasts  populating collagen pads, TSP-1 incorporation into the matrix did not activate transforming growth factor- \u03b2   responses, but inhibited leptin-induced matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation. TSP-1 disruption abrogated age- associated capillary rarefaction in db/db mice, attenuating myocardial upregulation of angiopoietin-2, a mediator  that induces vascular regression. In vitro, TSP-1 stimulation increased macrophage, but not endothelial cell,  angiopoietin-2 synthesis. Conclusions:  TSP-1 upregulation in the diabetic heart prevents chamber dilation by exerting matrix-preserving  actions on cardiac fibroblasts and mediates capillary rarefaction through effects that may involve angiopoietin-2  upregulation.\u2002 \u200a\u200a( Circ Res . 2013;113:1331-1344.)",
