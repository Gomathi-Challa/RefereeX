    "abstract": "There are many papers published on the use of 2D images for object representation. The fundamental issue with these approaches lies in the fact that a conventional image maps 3D real world objects into a 2D plane. This causes loss of 3D information -which means loss of 3D features as well for further analysis. There have been attempts using 3D and 2.5D scanners in order to access range data from objects for further analysis. However, these systems require special scanners and associated hardware, and many a times the complete information that is obtained from such systems is not required for further analysis. In this paper, we propose a simple system that projects a light beam over an object of interest and using a simple optical camera a video is recorded. This enables us to have 2D data as acquired from the camera along with the 3D data that is derived out of the deviations in the scan pattern because of the non-planarity of the object of interest. We have limited our research to using 3D features only for object representation and extended the same logic for face verification. The results that we have obtained show that in spite of using only 3D features, the system is able to verify faces with varied expressions correctly on 75% of the test data. The system is robust to slight tilt in head angle and normal human expressions like smile, frown, grin etc.",

    "abstract": "Integrated circuits based on low supply voltage and subthreshold operations of NMOS devices are very attractive for low power applications. An effective way to reduce supply voltage and resulting in power consumption without losing the circuit performance of NMOS is to increase the drive current of NMOS. This paper reports the scaling analysis of NMOS from deepsubmicron to nanometer technologies, in which channel length has been scaled down from 600nm to 90nm. For simulation, ATLAS device simulator is used, by using the models LAMBARDI (CVT) mobility model and fixed Shockley-read-hall model recombination model. Simulation result depicts that threshold voltage is 0.26V at 600nm, 0.04V at 180nm and 0.01V at 90nm so nanometer range NMOS devices can be very attractive for low power and subthreshold operations.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, surveillance systems have gained increased importance in order to increase the safety and security of people. These systems have applications in various domains like home or bank security, traffic monitoring, defense; and in public places like railway stations, malls, airports, etc. Our goal is to develop an intelligent real-time surveillance system that can help in increasing the efficiency of the system. In order to cover a large area, we need to install more number of cameras that leads to more number of videos that are to be monitored simultaneously. This in turn increases human intervention and makes it error prone. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to automate the complete system. In the proposed system, cameras are placed in such a way that there is a significant overlap between the field of view of the cameras. This helps in establishing an association between the cameras. The proposed real time surveillance system detects and tracks the objects in motion and provides automatic warning in case of suspicious activities such as unidentified object and restricted zone monitoring. The system provides different views in different cameras, thereby helping in resolving the occlusion in a simple and novel way. The algorithm has been tested on a CPU platform (Intel dual core with 4 GB RAM) with four wireless IP cameras (1.3 MP EDiMAX camera with night vision support) with a processing rate of 10 fps. This system can handle up to eight cameras on a GPU platform (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480) with frame rate of 25fps.",
