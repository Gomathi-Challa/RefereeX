    "abstract": "Web Services provide efficient reusability mechanism, thereby reducing the development time and cost. Mostly the source code of web services is unavailable to other developers who use these services. The manual effort spent by them in testing these web services is very large in order to increase the interoperability. Thus, automated testing needs to be developed for testing these Web services. This paper reviews test cases for Web Services using reduction techniques Pair-Wise Testing (PWT) and Orthogonal Array Testing (OAT) and compares the two techniques with general method. The structure of Web Services is specified using UML diagrams. The pre and post conditions for the service rule are specified using Object Constraint Language (OCL). The framework transforms into WSDL-S specifications. These specifications are parsed and transformed into structured DOM tree. Test data set generated by this framework would satisfy the constraints of the WSDL. The test cases are then developed based on the data generated, documented in XML based test files. The number of test cases required by general testing, PWT, OAT are compared and the better testing technique for testing Web Services is determined.",

    "abstract": "Financial forecasting is an example of a signal processing problem which is challenging due to small sample sizes, high noise, non-stationarity, and non-linearity. Neural networks have been very successful in a number of signal processing applications. We discuss fundamental limitations and inherent difficulties when using neural networks for the processing of high noise, small sample size signals. Financial forecasting employing neural networks is a highly significant area for exploratory study. It has long been known that exact prediction is more of an art than a science but attempts can be made to recognize trends and patterns which should help in predicting correctly within an order of magnitude. Our approach uses a typical back propagation neural net and employs various formulas on quantitative data. We picked our training stocks from different categories having varying prices and volumes; this enabled a better analysis while generalizing our findings. While it has not been possible to provide exact predictions, a definite trend is evident in most cases. Statistically-oriented projections of the significance of these findings using standard regression analysis techniques show our approach to be simple yet effective. The historical data was obtained over a time period of 40 days for major stocks on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This data was used to train the network while trying out various parameter values and techniques which are discussed below",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a tool supported approach to perform efficient regression testing of web services. Functional and non-functional web service testing is done with the help of WSDL parsing and regression testing is performed by identifying the changes made thereafter. We identify, categorize, and capture the web service regression testing needs into three different categories, namely, changes in WSDL, changes in code, and selective re-testing of web service operations. To capture above three changes we proposed three intermediate forms of WSDL, namely, Difference WSDL (DWSDL), Unit WSDL (UWSDL), and Reduced WSDL (RWSDL), respectively. These intermediate forms of WSDLs are then combined to form Combined WSDL (CWSDL) which is further used for regression testing of the web service. This approach is prototyped as a tool, named as Automatic Web Service Change Management (AWSCM), which helps in performing the efficient regression testing of web services by selecting the relevant test cases to constructing reduced test suite from the old test suite file of SoapUI. The reduction in the effort for regression testing of web service is estimated by two proposed cost metrics. We present three case studies demonstrating the applicability of the proposed tool for the real world projects.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is a cutting-edge technology that functions similarly to the human nervous system. Neural networks are at the heart of Deep Learning. Neural networks are made up of numerous layers, including the input layer, which accepts raw data as input, hidden layers, which process the input data, and a final layer, the output layer, which provides the result. Its workflow pattern is comparable to machine learning [2], [11], allowing us to gain hands-on expertise with this technology, speed up our work, and allow us to make several efforts without having to develop a basic Machine learning algorithm from scratch. In the case of deep learning, there are several neural networks to choose from. The majority of Deep Learning architectures are built on neural networks such as CNN, RNN, and others. Deep neural network activation function development is often guided by set goals and gradual steps toward tackling specific challenges. The primary goal of this study is to examine the performance of innovative activation functions (SBAF parabola [6] [16], AReLU [7], Leaky ReLU, SWISH) on deep learning architectures such as CNN, DENSENET, etc. On deep learning architectures, our study will compare the classification performance of the aforementioned activation functions. Our code: -allows the user to run DL architectures on selected computer vision datasets using selected activation functions; -allows the user to display classification accuracies and other performance parameters; -reports different validation curves to validate system performance; -runs the code for multiple loss functions",

Call Graph evolution analytics can assist a software engineer when maintaining or evolving a software system. This paper proposes Call Graph Evolution Analytics to extract information from a set of Evolving Call Graphs ECG = {𝐶𝐺 1 , 𝐶𝐺 2 , ...𝐶𝐺 𝑁 } representing a Version Series VS = {𝑉 1 , 𝑉 2 , ...𝑉 𝑁 } of an evolving software system. This is done using Call Graph Evolution Rules (CGERs) and Call Graph Evolution Subgraphs (CGESs). Similar to association rule mining, the CGERs are used to capture co-occurrences of dependencies in the system. Like subgraph patterns in a call graph, the CGESs are used to capture evolution of dependency patterns in evolving call graphs. Call graph analytics on the evolution in these patterns can identify potentially affected dependencies (or procedure calls) that need attention. The experiments are done on the evolving call graphs of 10 large evolving systems to support dependency evolution management. This is demonstrated with detailed results for evolving call graphs of Maven-Core's version series. • Software and its engineering → Software libraries and repositories; • Information systems → Data mining.",

We can use these evolving networks to do learning over evolving system states for system evolution analysis. In this paper, we introduce a System Evolution Analytics model, which is based on proposed System Evolution Learning. The network pattern information is trained using graph structure learning. The evolution information is trained using evolution and change learning. We accomplish this by implementing a deep evolution learning. This technique uses an evolving matrix to generate evolving memory in the form of a proposed System Neural Network (SysNN). The SysNN is useful to predict and recommend based on system evolution learning. The technique is prototyped as a tool, which is used to do experiments on six evolving systems. We applied our tool to do system evolution analysis. The experiments are conducted to generate and report evolving memory as SysNN that helps to do recommendation about system.",

Thus, we conducted a multiyear environmental study to scrutinize the occurrence of members of genus Vibrio in the largest west flowing river of the Indian subcontinent, which is also the largest river of central India, the Narmada. Statistical analysis was done to reveal major environmental factors controlling the presence of Vibrio sp in the river Narmada. Monthly field samplings were conducted between January 2002 and December 2003 at four different sites in Jabalpur (MP), India. At each site, water samples were taken and physicochemical and bacteriological parameters were measured. The identity of the isolates was confirmed by employing 16S rRNA analysis. The organisms were found to be widely distributed in the river with regular seasonal variations. The density of Vibrio was found to be correlated with temperature, coliforms and other heterotrophic bacteria. Water temperature accounted for most of the variability in the concentration of Vibrio sp As typical fecal pollution indicators may not access public health risk from potential pathogens such as vibrios, hence special monitoring programme for vibrios may adequately be included in the water quality management.",

    "abstract": "Service can be very costly as it tends to generates large number of test cases. Regression testing cost can be reduced significantly by identifying and testing the modified portion of the Web Service only. This avoids the costly construction of new test cases and the unproductive rerunning of existing test cases when it can be guaranteed that the unmodified code of web service will produce the same results as it produced previously. In this paper, by designing Web service graph we propose an effective method of identifying the modified areas (in this paper area means code of web service to be tested) and use this information to reduce regression testing efforts. In this process, we define and use a set of metrics to categorize the testing of Web service. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach using a case study that consisted of two steps. In the first step, we compared two versions of WSDL's to identify the inserted, modified and deleted areas of the Web services. Next, we use this information to generate the reduced test cases.",

This improves and optimizes cost of Web service analysis by slicing and layering the Service. We conducted case studies for few Service projects.

Internally, GECL uses Deep Evolution Learner (DEL) to learn about evolution and changes happened over a system state series. The DEL is an extension of the deep learning algorithm, which uses an Evolving Connection Matrix (ECM) representing temporal patterns of the evolving entity-connections for training incremental states. The DEL generates a Deep System Neural Network (Deep SysNN) to do network (graph) reconstruction. The SysEvoRecomd extracts the evolving characteristic of graph with deep neural network techniques. It aims to learn the evolution and changes of the system state series to reconstruct the system network. Our key idea is to design three variants of GECL based on three remodeled deep learning techniques: Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and denoising Autoencoder (dA). Based on proposed SysEvoRecomd algorithm, we developed a SysEvoRecomd-Tool, which is applied on different evolving systems: software, natural language, multi-sport event, retail market, and IMDb movie genre. We demonstrated the usefulness of intelligent recommendations using three variants of GECL based on RBM, DBN, and dA.",

    "abstract": "System Evolution Analytics on a system that evolves is a challenge because it makes a State Series SS = {S1, S2… SN} (i.e., a set of states ordered by time) with several inter-connected entities changing over time. We present stability characteristics of interesting evolution rules occurring in multiple states. We defined an evolution rule with its stability as the fraction of states in which the rule is interesting. Extensively, we defined stable rule as the evolution rule having stability that exceeds a given threshold minimum stability (minStab). We also defined persistence metric, a quantitative measure of persistent entity-connections. We explain this with an approach and algorithm for System Network Analytics (SysNet-Analytics), which uses minStab to retrieve Network Evolution Rules (NERs) and Stable NERs (SNERs). The retrieved information is used to calculate a proposed System Network Persistence (SNP) metric. This work is automated as a SysNet-Analytics Tool to demonstrate application on real world systems including: software system, natural-language system, retail market system, and IMDb system. We quantified stability and persistence of entity-connections in a system state series. This results in evolution information, which helps in system evolution analytics based on knowledge discovery and data mining.",

    "abstract": "System evolution analytics with artificial neural networks is a challenging and path-breaking direction, which could ease intelligent processes for systems that evolve over time. In this paper, we contribute an approach to do Evolution and Change Learning (ECL), which uses an evolution representor and forms a System Neural Network (SysNN). We proposed an algorithm System Structure Learning (SSL), which is divided in two steps. First step uses the evolution representor as an evolving matrix Evolving Design Structure Matrix (EDSM) for intelligent design learning. Second step uses a Deep Evolution Learner (DEL) that learns from evolution and changes patterns of an EDSM to generate Deep SysNN. The result demonstrates application of the proposed approach to analyze four real-world system domains: software, natural-language, retail market, and movie genre. We achieved significant learning over highly imbalanced datasets. The learning from previous states formed SysNN as a feed-forward neural network, and then memorized information as an output matrix that has recommendations for entity-connections. Impact Statement -It is useful and challenging to apply machine learning to analyze the multiple states of an evolving system. To do this, we represented existing states of an evolving system as EDSM that is used to generate SysNN. The SysNN generates an output matrix that helps to analyze and make recommendations about that evolving system. We present experiments to study imbalanced data of evolving systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Web Service Slicing, a technique that captures a functional subset of a large-scale web service using an interface slice captured as a WSDL slice (a subset of a service's WSDL). An interface (WSDL) slice provides access to an interoperable slice, which is a functional subset of the service's code. The technique uses intra-operational and inter-operational analysis to identify web service changes. With the aid of an associative code-test mapping, we leverage the identification of affected operations to reduce the cost of web-service regression testing by extracting a subset of the existing test cases. Used in conjunction with a web service slice, this subset reduces the cost of web-service regression testing by enabling the running of fewer tests. Furthermore, we exploit two approaches: Operationalized Regression Testing of Web Services (ORTWS) and Parameterized Regression Testing of Web Services (PRTWS). ORTWS effectively tests intra-operational changes at the WSDL and WS-code levels, while PRTWS tests inter-operational changes involving inter-operational dependencies due to primary parameters. Finally, we present results obtained using our prototype implementation, AWSCM (Automatic Web Service Change Management), in two case-study experiments that serve to illustrate the reduction potential of the technique using eight realworld web services.",
