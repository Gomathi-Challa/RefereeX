    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on clustering: exiting methods and developments made at various times. Clustering is defined as an unsupervised learning where the objects are grouped on the basis of some similarity inherent among them. There are different methods for clustering the objects such as hierarchical, partitional, grid, density based and model based. The approaches used in these methods are discussed with their respective states of art and applicability. The measures of similarity as well as the evaluation criteria, which are the central components of clustering are also presented in the paper. The applications of clustering in some fields like image segmentation, object and character recognition and data mining are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of Withania somnifera (Ws) to limit myocardial injury after ischemia and reperfusion was explored and compared to that of Vit E, a reference standard known to reduce mortality and infarct size due to myocardial infarction. Wistar rats (150-200 g) were divided into six groups and received orally saline (sham, control group), Ws-50/kg (Ws control and treated group) and Vit E-100 mg/kg (Vit E control and treated group) respectively for 1 month. On the 31st day, rats of the control, Vit E and Ws treated groups were anesthetized and subjected to 45 min occlusion of the LAD coronary artery followed by 60 min reperfusion. Hemodynamic parameters: systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP, MAP), heart rate (HR), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular peak (+)LVdP/dt and (-)LVdP/dt were monitored. Hearts were removed and processed for histopathological and biochemical studies: Myocardial enzyme viz, creatin phosphokinase (CPK), and antioxidant parameters: malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) were estimated. Postischemic reperfusion produced significant cardiac necrosis, depression of left ventricular functions (MAP, LVEDP, (+) and (-)LVdP/dt) and a significant fall in GSH (p < 0.01), SOD, CAT (p < 0.05), LDH and CPK (p < 0.01) as well as an increase in MDA level (p < 0.05) in the control group rats as compared to sham group. The changes in levels of protein and GPx was however, not significant. Ws and Vit E favorably modulated most of the hemodynamic, biochemical and histopathological parameters though no significant restoration in GSH, MAP (with Vit E) were observed. Ws on chronic administration markedly augmented antioxidants (GSH, GSHPx, SOD, CAT) while Vit E did not stimulate the synthesis of endogenous antioxidants compared to sham. Results indicate that Ws significantly reduced myocardial injury and emphasize the beneficial action of Ws as a cardioprotective agent. (Mol Cell Biochem 260: 39-47, 2004)",

    "abstract": "Industrial demands have generated a growing need to synthesize pure metal and metal-oxide nanoparticles of a desired size. We report a novel and convenient method for the synthesis of spherical, size tunable, well dispersed, stable nickel and nickel oxide nanoparticles by reduction of nickel nitrate at room temperature in a TX-100/n-hexanol/cyclohexane/water system by a reverse microemulsion route. We determined that reduction with alkaline sodium borohydrate in nitrogen atmosphere leads to the formation of nickel nanoparticles, while the use of hydrazine hydrate in aerobic conditions leads to the formation of nickel oxide nanoparticles. The influence of several reaction parameters on the size of nickel and nickel oxide nanoparticles were evaluated in detail. It was found that the size can be easily controlled either by changing the molar ratio of water to surfactant or by simply altering the concentration of the reducing agent. The morphology and structure of the nanoparticles were characterized by quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), electron diffraction analysis (EDA) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The results show that synthesized nanoparticles are of high purity and have an average size distribution of 5-100 nm. The nanoparticles prepared by our simple methodology have been successfully used for catalyzing various chemical reactions.",

    "abstract": "CD8 T cells are emerging as important players in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis, although their direct contribution to tissue damage is still debated. To assess whether autoreactive CD8 T cells can contribute to the pronounced loss of oligodendrocytes observed in MS plaques, we generated mice in which the model Ag influenza hemagglutinin is selectively expressed in oligodendrocytes. Transfer of preactivated hemagglutininspecific CD8 T cells led to inflammatory lesions in the optic nerve, spinal cord, and brain. These lesions, associating CD8 T cell infiltration with focal loss of oligodendrocytes, demyelination, and microglia activation, were very reminiscent of active MS lesions. Thus, our study demonstrates the potential of CD8 T cells to induce oligodendrocyte lysis in vivo as a likely consequence of direct Ag-recognition. These results provide new insights with regard to CNS tissue damage mediated by CD8 T cells and for understanding the role of CD8 T cells in MS.",

    "abstract": "Objective-Effective postinfarction repair requires timely suppression of innate immune signals to prevent the catastrophic consequences of uncontrolled inflammation on cardiac geometry and function. In macrophages, interleukin-1 receptorassociated kinase (IRAK)-M acts as a functional decoy preventing uncontrolled toll-like receptor /interleukin-1-mediated responses. Our study investigates the role of IRAK-M as a negative regulator of the postinfarction inflammatory response and as a modulator of cardiac remodeling. Methods and Results-In wild-type mouse infarcts IRAK-M was upregulated in infiltrating macrophages and fibroblasts exhibiting a biphasic response. When compared with wild-type animals, infarcted IRAK-M -/-mice had enhanced adverse remodeling and worse systolic dysfunction; however, acute infarct size was comparable between groups. Adverse remodeling in IRAK-M -/-animals was associated with enhanced myocardial inflammation and protease activation. The protective actions of IRAK-M involved phenotypic modulation of macrophages and fibroblasts. IRAK-M -/-infarcts showed increased infiltration with proinflammatory CD11b+/Ly6C hi monocytes; leukocytes harvested from IRAK-M-null infarcts exhibited accentuated cytokine expression. In vitro, IRAK-M expression was upregulated in cytokine-stimulated murine cardiac fibroblasts and suppressed their matrix-degrading properties without affecting their inflammatory activity. Conclusion-Endogenous IRAK-M attenuates adverse postinfarction remodeling suppressing leukocyte inflammatory activity, while inhibiting fibroblast-mediated matrix degradation.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutics for patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed during the pandemic. Bamlanivimab is a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody that blocks severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) attachment and entry into human cells, which could potentially lead to therapeutic benefit. J2W-MC-PYAA was a randomized, double-blind, sponsor unblinded, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose first-in-human trial (NCT04411628) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 24 patients received either placebo or a single dose of bamlanivimab (700 mg, 2,800 mg, or 7,000 mg). The primary objective was assessment of safety and tolerability, including adverse events and serious adverse events, with secondary objectives of pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic analyses. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates were identical in the placebo and pooled bamlanivimab groups (66.7%). There were no apparent dose-related increases in the number or severity of TEAEs. There were no serious adverse events or deaths during the study, and no discontinuations due to adverse events. PKs of bamlanivimab is linear and exposure increased proportionally with dose following single i.v. administration. The half-life was ~ 17 days. These results demonstrate the favorable safety profile of bamlanivimab, and provided the initial critical evaluation of safety, tolerability, and PKs in support of the development of bamlanivimab in several ongoing clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this work is to produce nanocomposite film with low oxygen permeability by casting an aqueous solution containing xylan, sorbitol and nanocrystalline cellulose. The morphology of the resulting nanocomposite films was examined by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy which showed that control films containing xylan and sorbitol had a more open structure as compared to xylan-sorbitol films containing sulfonated nanocrystalline cellulose. The average pore diameter, bulk density, porosity and tortuosity factor measurements of control xylan films and nanocomposite xylan films were examined by mercury intrusion porosimetry techniques. Xylan films reinforced with nanocrystalline cellulose were denser and exhibited higher tortuosity factor than the control xylan films. Control xylan films had average pore diameter, bulk density, porosity and tortuosity factor of 0.1730 μm, 0.6165 g/ml , 53.0161% and 1.258, respectively as compared to xylan films reinforced with 50% nanocrystalline cellulose with average pore diameter of 0.0581 μm, bulk density of 1.1513 g/ml, porosity of 22.8906% and tortuosity factor of 2.005. Oxygen transmission rate tests demonstrated that films prepared with xylan, sorbitol and 5%, 10%, 25% and 50% sulfonated nanocrystalline cellulose exhibited a significantly reduced oxygen permeability of 1.1387, 1.0933, 0.8986 and 0.1799 cm 3 μm/m 2 dkPa respectively with respect to films prepared solely from xylan and sorbitol with a oxygen permeability of 189.1665 cm 3 μm/m 2 dkPa. These properties suggested these nanocomposite films have promising barrier properties.",

    "abstract": "Background-Cardiac manifestations of neonatal lupus include conduction disease and, rarely, an isolated cardiomyopathy. This study was initiated to determine the mortality and morbidity of cardiac neonatal lupus and associated risk factors in a multi-racial/ethnic US-based registry to provide insights into the pathogenesis of antibody-mediated injury and data for counseling. Three hundred twenty-five offspring exposed to maternal anti-SSA/Ro antibodies with cardiac neonatal lupus met entry criteria. Maternal, fetal echocardiographic, and neonatal risk factors were assessed for association with mortality. Fifty-seven (17.5%) died, 30% in utero. The probability of in utero death was 6%. The cumulative probability of survival at 10 years for a child born alive was 86%. Fetal echocardiographic risk factors associated with increased mortality in a multivariable analysis of all cases included hydrops and endocardial fibroelastosis. Significant predictors of in utero death were hydrops and earlier diagnosis, and of postnatal death were hydrops, endocardial fibroelastosis, and lower ventricular rate. Isolated heart block was associated with a 7.8% case fatality rate, whereas the concomitant presence of dilated cardiomyopathy or endocardial fibroelastosis quadrupled the case fatality rate. There was a significantly higher case fatality rate in minorities compared with whites, who were at a lower risk of hydrops and endocardial fibroelastosis. Pacing was required in 70%; cardiac transplantation was required in 4 children. Conclusion-Nearly one fifth of fetuses who develop cardiac neonatal lupus die of complications predicted by echocardiographic abnormalities consistent with antibody-associated disease beyond the atrioventricular node. The disparity in outcomes observed between minorities and whites warrants further investigation. (Circulation. 2011; 124:1927-1935.) Key Words: antibodies Ⅲ cardiomyopathy Ⅲ heart block Ⅲ morbidity Ⅲ mortality N eonatal lupus (NL), initially described in the late 1970s, represents a pathological readout of passively acquired autoimmunity. [1][2][3][4] Identification of advanced fetal heart block in the absence of structural abnormalities predicts the presence of maternal autoantibody responses against the ribonucleoproteins SSA/Ro and SSB/La in Ͼ85% of cases. 5 Of the affected offspring, 10% to 15% will have a lifethreatening cardiomyopathy, occasionally without associated conduction disease. 6 -9  Prospective studies of pregnancies in women with the candidate antibodies have estimated the risk of cardiac NL at Ϸ2% if the mother has had no previously affected pregnancies. 10 -13  Recurrence rates in subsequent pregnancies are approximately 8-to 9-fold this risk. 14 -19  In addition, the occurrence rate of cardiac NL after a child with cutaneous NL is Ϸ6-fold higher. 20 Maternal health status does not appear to be a contributing factor to the risk of having a child with cardiac NL, but the relationship to severity of disease has not been addressed. 14,21 Available data on estimates of the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiac NL have been derived from several groups in different countries, spanning 2 decades. 5,14,15,[22][23][24][25] These studies differ in cohort size, ranging from 55 fetuses 14 to 175 fetuses. 25 The overall case fatality rates range from 11% 22 to 29%. 5 The percentages of children receiving pacemakers vary from 63% 15 to 93%. 22 However, these studies did not uniformly require the presence of maternal anti-SSA/Ro or SSB/La antibodies as an inclusion criterion. For several studies, up to 40% of the cases included were not",

    "abstract": "Background-A recent case-control study suggested a benefit of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in lowering the risk of cardiac manifestations of neonatal lupus (cardiac-NL) in pregnancies of anti-SSA/Ro-positive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. A historical cohort assembled from 3 international databases was used to evaluate whether HCQ reduces the nearly 10-fold increase in risk of recurrence of cardiac-NL independently of maternal health status. Methods and Results-Two hundred fifty-seven pregnancies of anti-SSA/Ro-positive mothers (40 exposed and 217 unexposed to HCQ) subsequent to the birth of a child with cardiac-NL were identified from 3 databases (United States, England, and France). Exposure was defined as the sustained use of HCQ throughout pregnancy with initiation before 10 weeks of gestation. The recurrence rate of cardiac-NL in fetuses exposed to HCQ was 7.5% (3 of 40) compared with 21.2% (46 of 217) in the unexposed group (Pϭ0.050). Although there were no deaths in the exposed group, the overall case fatality rate of the cardiac-NL fetuses in the unexposed group was 21.7%. In a multivariable analysis that adjusted for database source, maternal race/ethnicity, and anti-SSB/La status, HCQ use remained significantly associated with a decreased risk of cardiac-NL (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.06 -0.92; Pϭ0.037). Similar results were obtained with propensity score analysis, an alternative approach to adjust for possible confounding by indication. Conclusion-Aggregate data from a multinational effort show that in mothers at high risk of having a child with cardiac-NL, the use of HCQ may protect against recurrence of disease in a subsequent pregnancy.

    "abstract": "Moisture barrier properties of films based on xylan reinforced with several cellulosic resources including nanocrystalline cellulose, acacia bleached kraft pulp fibers and softwood kraft fibers have been evaluated. Measurements of water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) were performed by a modification of the wet cup method described by ASTM E 96-95, indicating that membranes with 10% nanocrystalline cellulose, prepared using a sulfuric acid, exhibited the lowest permeability value of 174 g mil/h m 2 among the composite films studied. Both the acacia and the softwood kraft pulp fibers when used for xylan film formation exhibited higher water vapor transmission rates at addition levels of 50% and no improvement at lower levels of 5% and 10%, in comparison to control xylan films. Reinforcement of xylan with hydrochloric acid made nanocrystalline cellulose yielded films that showed a reduction in water transmission but the reduction was not as significant as with the reinforcement of xylan with sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose. The results showed that xylan films reinforced with 10% sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose exhibited reductions in water transmission rates of 362%, 62% and 61% over films prepared with 10% softwood kraft fibers, 10% acacia fiber and 10% hydrochloric acid prepared nanocrystalline cellulose, respectively. The morphology of the resulting nanocomposite films was examined by SEM and AFM which showed that control films containing xylan and sorbitol had a more open structure as compared to xylan-sorbitol films containing sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose. The results from FT-IR suggested strong interactions occurred between the nanocrystalline cellulose and the matrix.",

    "abstract": "We describe here the paradoxical development of spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in transgenic mice expressing a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific T cell antigen receptor (TCR) in the absence of MOG. We report that in Mog-deficient mice (Mog -/-), the autoimmune response by transgenic T cells is redirected to a neuronal cytoskeletal self antigen, neurofilament-M (NF-M). Although components of radically different protein classes, the cross-reacting major histocompatibility complex I-A b -restricted epitope sequences of MOG 35-55 and NF-M 18-30 share essential TCR contact positions. This pattern of cross-reaction is not specific to the transgenic TCR but is also commonly seen in MOG 35-55 -I-A b -reactive T cells. We propose that in the C57BL/6 mouse, MOG and NF-M response components add up to overcome the general resistance of this strain to experimental induction of autoimmunity. Similar cumulative responses against more than one autoantigen may have a role in spontaneously developing human autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-βs regulate a wide range of cellular responses by activating Smad-dependent and Smad-independent cascades. In the infarcted heart, Smad3 signaling is activated in both cardiomyocytes and interstitial cells. We hypothesized that cell-specific actions of Smad3 regulate repair and remodeling in the infarcted myocardium. To dissect cell-specific Smad3 actions in myocardial infarction, we generated mice with Smad3 loss in activated fibroblasts or cardiomyocytes. Cardiac function was assessed after reperfused or nonreperfused infarction using echocardiography. The effects of cell-specific Smad3 loss on the infarcted heart were studied using histological studies, assessment of protein, and gene expression levels. In vitro, we studied Smad-dependent and Smadindependent actions in isolated cardiac fibroblasts. Mice with fibroblast-specific Smad3 loss had accentuated adverse remodeling after reperfused infarction and exhibited an increased incidence of late rupture after nonreperfused infarction. The consequences of fibroblast-specific Smad3 loss were not a result of effects on acute infarct size but were associated with unrestrained fibroblast proliferation, impaired scar remodeling, reduced fibroblast-derived collagen synthesis, and perturbed alignment of myofibroblast arrays in the infarct. Polarized light microscopy in Sirius red-stained sections demonstrated that the changes in fibroblast morphology were associated with perturbed organization of the collagenous matrix in the infarcted area. In contrast, α-smooth muscle actin expression by infarct myofibroblasts was not affected by Smad3 loss. Smad3 critically regulated fibroblast function, activating integrin-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-2 (NOX-2) expression. Smad3 loss in cardiomyocytes attenuated remodeling and dysfunction after infarction. Cardiomyocyte-specific Smad3 loss did not affect acute infarct size but was associated with attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the remodeling myocardium, accompanied by decreased myocardial NOX-2 levels, reduced nitrosative stress, and lower matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. In healing myocardial infarction, myofibroblast-and cardiomyocyte-specific activation of Smad3 has contrasting functional outcomes that may involve activation of an integrin/reactive oxygen axis.",

EMBRACE (GSK Study BEL115471; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01632241) was a 52-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults of self-identified Black race with active SLE who received monthly belimumab 10 mg/kg IV, or placebo, plus standard therapy. The optional 26-week open-label extension phase included patients who completed the double-blind phase. The primary end point of the study was SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rate at week 52 with modified proteinuria scoring adapted from the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) (SRI-SLEDAI-2K). Key secondary end points included SRI response rate at week 52, time to first severe SLE flare, and reductions in prednisone dose. Results. The modified intent-to-treat population comprised 448 patients, of whom 96.9% were women and the mean AE SD age was 38.8 AE 11.42 years. The primary end point (improvement in the SRI-SLEDAI-2K response rate at week 52) was not achieved (belimumab 48.7%, placebo 41.6%; odds ratio 1.40 [95% confidence interval 0.93, 2.11], P = 0.1068); however, numerical improvements favoring belimumab were observed, in which the SRI-SLEDAI-2K response rates were higher in those who received belimumab compared with those who received placebo, especially in patients with SLE who had high disease activity or renal manifestations at baseline. The safety profile of belimumab was generally consistent with that observed in previous SLE trials. Adverse events were the primary reasons for double-blind phase withdrawals (belimumab 5.4%, placebo 6.7%). Conclusion. The primary end point of this study was not achieved, but improvement with belimumab versus placebo was observed, suggesting that belimumab remains a suitable treatment option for SLE management in patients of Black African ancestry.

Dyes contaminate water and are addressed extensively by researchers. Various technologies and materials have been developed for the treatment of contaminated water. Among them, adsorption has attracted great attention due to its ease and cost-effective nature. In recent years, graphene-based composites have shown great potential for the removal of contaminants from water. The literature reveals the usefulness of composites of graphene with metal oxides, carbon derivatives, metal hybrids and polymers for the removal of organic dyes from contaminated water. In this review, efforts have been made to compile the studies on the removal of cationic and anionic dyes from water using graphene-based composites.",

    "abstract": "D iabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with increased susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. 1,2 Data derived from the Framingham study suggest that men with diabetes mellitus have a 2.4-fold higher incidence of heart failure; the risk of heart failure is even higher (5.1-fold) in diabetic women. 3 The increased prevalence of heart failure in diabetes mellitus is only in part because of the increased risk of atherosclerotic coronary disease and its complications. Diabetics also develop a unique cardiomyopathic condition, termed diabetic cardiomyopathy, 4-6 that is independent of coronary artery disease. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by extensive fibrotic changes, expansion of the cardiac interstitium, 7 and profound alterations in the cardiac interstitial matrix 8 leading to increased myocardial stiffness and development of diastolic dysfunction. 9 Despite its significance, the pathophysiologic basis of cardiac fibrosis in diabetes mellitus remains poorly understood. Tissue fibrosis requires the dynamic participation of the extracellular matrix and is regulated by a family of structurally unrelated macromolecules called matricellular proteins. 10 Matricellular proteins are generally not expressed in the Integrative Physiology",
